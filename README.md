# active-ip-sniffer
A simple Python3.9 program that sniffs the entire network and dumps active IPs into a log file, so make sure you have the file named active-ip-sniffer.py in its own dir.
It's easy to use you just run it there is no interface it scans the whole network automatically.
Also this is my first project I am still learning Python so the code is kinda messy but it does it's job.
So far this only works if your ip is 192.168.2.x but i am working on expanding it.
