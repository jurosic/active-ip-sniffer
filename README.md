# active-ip-sniffer
A simple Python3.9 program that sniffs the entire network and dumps active IPs into a log file, so make sure you have the file named active-ip-sniffer.py in its own dir.  
It's easy to use you just run it there is no interface it scans the whole network automatically.  
Also this is my first project I am still learning Python so the code is kinda messy but it does it's job.  
So far this only works if your ip is 192.168.2.x but i am working on expanding it.  


UPDATES:
Update 1.0:  
   Sorted files into folders.  
     
   Active.txt and Unactive.txt are now created in folder called Log which is also created automatically.   
    
   Program now starts with start.sh i think that that's easier to use.  
    
   !!(IF START.SH ISN'T WORKING DO "chmod +x start.sh" AND THEN "./start.sh")!!  
    
   Program now also uses a menu because i plan on adding more features.  
   
Update 1.1:
   Added a port sniffer aswell works but there bight be minor bugs that i will fix in the future.
