# active-ip-sniffer
A simple Python3.9 program that sniffs the entire network and dumps active IPs into a log file
It's easy to use you just run it there is no interface it scans the whole network automatically
Also this is my first project I am still learning Python so the code is kinda messy but it does it's job.
