# active-ip-sniffer


DISCLAIMER!: THIS TOOL WAS MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY I DO NOT YIELD ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS TOOL FOR.


A simple Python3.9 program that sniffs the entire network and dumps active IPs into a log file, so make sure you have the file named active-ip-sniffer.py in its own dir.  
It's easy to use you just run it there is no gui, just command line. It scans the whole network automatically.  
Also this is my first project I am still learning Python so the code is kinda messy but it does it's job.  


UPDATES:
Update 1.0:  
   Sorted files into folders.  
     
   Active.txt and Unactive.txt are now created in folder called Log which is also created automatically.   
    
   Program now starts with start.sh i think that that's easier to use.  
    
   !!(IF START.SH ISN'T WORKING DO "chmod +x start.sh" AND THEN "./start.sh")!!  
    
   Program now also uses a menu because i plan on adding more features.  
   
Update 1.1:
   Added a port sniffer aswell works but there might be minor bugs that i will fix in the future.

Update 1.2:
   Added a gateway scanner for wifi routers.
   IP Scanner now works with 192.168.x.x, so you can now scan 192.168.1.x, .2.x, .3.x and so on.
